# Taxi-Fare-Predictor
# Project Overview:
This project aims to build a predictive fare estimator for New York taxis, enabling commuters to effectively plan and manage their travel expenses.

# Key Features:
Predictive Fare Estimator: Developed a predictive model to estimate taxi fares based on various input features.
Data Analysis: Analyzed a dataset comprising 50,000 taxi fare records, implementing outlier removal techniques and incorporating distance features between pickup and drop-off locations, as well as landmarks.
Model Selection: Employed Random Forest as the primary predictive model over baseline models, achieving superior performance metrics.
# Methodology:
Data Collection: Gathered a dataset containing taxi fare records from New York.
Data Preprocessing: Conducted data preprocessing tasks, including outlier removal and feature engineering.
Feature Engineering: Incorporated distance features between pickup and drop-off locations, as well as landmarks, to enhance model performance.
Model Training: Trained a Random Forest regression model using the preprocessed dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of the trained model using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Performance Comparison: Compared the performance of the Random Forest model with baseline models to assess improvements in accuracy.
# Conclusion:
The taxi fare prediction model developed in this project provides commuters with a reliable tool to estimate travel expenses accurately. By leveraging Random Forest and incorporating distance features, the model achieves lower RMSE, MAE, and MSE values compared to baseline models, resulting in a 17% improvement in accuracy. This predictive capability enhances commuters' ability to plan and manage their travel budgets effectively.
